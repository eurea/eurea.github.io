## Experience calculator usage
  - Input the current level of your weapon/summon/character and your target level to see the total experience needed.
  - The calculator will display the needed Vessels **OR** Archangel Items to reach the target level.
  - Note that the calculator will always give the base weapons needed (i.e. Total Experience is 1001: given that bonus experience is 0%, Archangel Weapons will display 3.)
