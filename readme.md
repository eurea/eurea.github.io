# GBF Spark and Experience Calculator
 **A simple calculator for calculating how much fodder you need or how much rolls you have.**
 **Now with PWA features and written with React!**

### Spark calculator usage
- Enter you crystals, single tickets and 10x tickets.
- Calculator will display your total rolls and spark completion rate where 100% is 300 rolls.
- All entered values are saved for future usage on your local device.

### Experience calculator usage
- Input the current level of your weapon/summon/character and your target level to see the total exp needed.
- The calculator will display the needed Vessels **OR** Archangel Items to reach the target level.
- Note that the calculator will always give the base weapons needed (i.e. Total exp is 1001: given that bonus exp is 0%, Archangel Weapons will display 3.)
